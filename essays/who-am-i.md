## A little more...
    I was born on Oahu in 1992. I have lived my entire life here on Oahu and moved around often while at a young age from Mililani, to Makakilo, to Kaimuki and presently Kaka'ako. I used to enjoy the classic hikes, beaches and typical "Hawaii" activities, however with age, experience and life's crazy curve balls, I've found that my priorities have shifted rather swiftly. I spend my time either working, studying, attending lectures, sleeping, and spending time with those most dear to me. Sometimes I find myself grouping two activities together, for example and most frequently, attending lectures and sleeping simultaneously. School has always been a struggle for me, especially maintaining interest...but once interest is obtained, that's when the fun begins.
