Why would this student choose to enroll in ITM 352?

Most students attempt to define themselves while sticking to a pathway that they have chosen or has had chosen for them. Selecting a career path can prove to be difficult especially at a young age. College requires a certain sense of well-roundedness. Consequently, instead of purely focusing on one's selected major, the student must venture off course and broaden horizons with general academics and electives before recieving their diploma. 

One of my electives is ITM 352. 

However, I chose to major in Finance ever since high school. I've always enjoyed learning about finance and accounting because I see real-world application every day. I wanted to learn more and be able to make well-informed decisions as I progress throughout life. I see the same benefits of real-world application when I think of MIS. Every day technological advancements are made effectively changing how things were once done. I want to be not only be involved but understand and adapt to these changes as they occur. 

The ability to learn new material is an essential life skill. Whether you have genuine interest or not, learning how to learn is a crucial skill that must be honed. 

Instead of only learning about where we've come from, we also need to learn about where we're going.
